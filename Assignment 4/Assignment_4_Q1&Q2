1. Due to commutative property among the operators i[arr] and arr[i] are same things and hence code works.

2. In first line it would be adrress and in second "abcde" will be printed since variables of an array points to the adrress of the first entry but in ch[6] we have given 5 entries so by default last one is assumed as \0 character and hence it is not trated as a array but string and hence instead of adrress , string is printed but as usual in arr adrress is printed.
